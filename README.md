### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m SomÄ“. Iâ€™m a classically trained pianist and creative developer now retraining to chase my dream of becoming a software developer. Right now, Iâ€™m looking both to expand my understanding and abilities as a developer and for opportunities to work as part of a team with the passion of building.

Here's a selection of projects:
- [Brahms Explorer](https://github.com/somecho/catalog-for-contemporary-music) - a searchable catalog for contemporary music with data scraped from IRCAM
- [All the sets](https://github.com/somecho/all-the-sets-frontend) - a small webapp to analyze and learn about Pitch Set Class Theory
- [Polymetro](https://github.com/somecho/polymetro2) - a polyrhythmic metronome ([live](https://polymetro.netlify.app))
- [OfxJFA](https://github.com/somecho/ofxJFA) - Jump Flooding for OpenFrameworks 

Not all the code of my projects are on Github, so please check out my [portfolio](https://somecho.github.io) for more things I've done!
